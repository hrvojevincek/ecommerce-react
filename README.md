# King ICT E-commerce Application

## Overview

This is a modern e-commerce application built with React and TypeScript, showcasing a responsive and user-friendly interface for browsing and purchasing products. The application demonstrates best practices in front-end development, state management, and API integration.

## Main Features

1. Product Catalog: Browse a wide range of products with detailed information.
2. Search Functionality: Easily find products using the search bar.
3. Category Filtering: Filter products by categories for a streamlined shopping experience.
4. Price Range Filtering: Narrow down product selection based on price ranges.
5. Sorting Options: Sort products by name or price, in ascending or descending order.
6. Pagination: Navigate through multiple pages of products effortlessly.
7. User Authentication: Secure login system for personalized user experiences.
8. Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used

- React 18.3
- TypeScript 5.5
- Vite 5.4 (for fast development and optimized builds)
- React Router 6.26 (for client-side routing)
- Tanstack Query 5.59 (for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management)
- Axios (for API requests)
- Tailwind CSS 3.4 (for styling)
- Radix UI (for accessible UI components)
- Lucide React (for icons)
- ESLint (for code linting)

## Architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture, leveraging React's composability. Key architectural decisions include:

1. **State Management**: Utilizes Tanstack Query for server state management and custom hooks for local state.

2. **API Integration**: Centralizes API calls in a dedicated service (`ApiService`) for better maintainability.

3. **Routing**: Implements protected routes for authenticated sections of the app using React Router.

4. **Component Structure**:

   - `components/`: Reusable UI components
   - `pages/`: Top-level components for each route
   - `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for shared logic
   - `services/`: API and other service-related code
   - `lib/`: Utility functions and helpers

5. **Styling**: Adopts Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, combined with custom components for consistent design.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Building for Production

Run `npm run build` to create an optimized production build.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

To maintain and upgrade the solution throughout its lifecycle, we recommend implementing the following CI/CD practices:

1. **Version Control**: Use Git for source code management, with a branching strategy like GitFlow or GitHub Flow.

2. **Automated Testing**:

   - Implement unit tests for components and utility functions.
   - Add integration tests for critical user flows.
   - Set up end-to-end tests using tools like Cypress or Playwright.

3. **Continuous Integration**:

   - Use a CI service (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins) to automatically run tests on every push or pull request.
   - Include linting and type-checking in the CI pipeline.

4. **Code Quality Checks**:

   - Integrate static code analysis tools.
   - Set up code coverage reports.
   - Implement pull request reviews to maintain code quality.

5. **Continuous Deployment**:

   - Automate deployments to staging environments for thorough testing.
   - Implement blue-green or canary deployments for production to minimize downtime and risk.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**:

   - Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry) to catch and diagnose issues quickly.
   - Implement application performance monitoring.

7. **Documentation**:

   - Keep README and other documentation up-to-date with each significant change.
   - Use tools like Storybook for component documentation.

8. **Dependency Management**:

   - Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities and leverage new features.
   - Use tools like Dependabot for automated dependency updates.

9. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Use environment variables for configuration to keep sensitive information secure.
   - Implement different configurations for development, staging, and production environments.

By following these practices, the application can be efficiently maintained, updated, and scaled over time, ensuring a robust and reliable user experience.
